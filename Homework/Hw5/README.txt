DESCRIPTION OF IMPROVED SHIPFREIGHT ALGORITHM FOR EXTRA CREDIT 
Aiming for optimal (fastest train speed, most freight, fewest number
of engines used, and fewest resulting trains) for any input.  Note:
Student choice on how to prioritze between these goals.  Describe your
priorization and your implementation.



DESCRIPTION OF IMPROVED SEPARATE ALGORITHM FOR EXTRA CREDIT 
Aiming for optimally comfortable trains (smaller values for average
distance to dining and/or larger values for closest engine to sleeper)
and/or optimally handling cases with > 2 engines.  Student choice on how 
to prioritze between these goals.  Describe your priorization and your
implementation.


MISC. COMMENTS TO GRADER:  
Optional, please be concise!
Hi, I couldn't find a way to optimize and lower the cost for my separate. When I pop back engines
from train 3 and put it in train 2 it costs a lot more than I thought it would.
