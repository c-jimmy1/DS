ESTIMATE OF # OF HOURS SPENT ON THIS ASSIGNMENT:  30


ALGORITHM ANALYSIS:
What's the order notation of your algorithm?
O(rows* cols * wordlength * num_words)


TEST CASE SUMMARY:
How did your program perform on the different test cases?  Summarize
the running times.  (It's ok if it didn't finish the harder examples.)
What new test cases did you create and how did it perform on those
tests?

My program only worked on the first test case. It only printed one solution though because the recurison was 
limited to one branch. I needed more time to fix this but I didn't have enough time because of other classes. 
I know that I can fix this by allowing multiple branches of recursion to run. I am also missing vertical and 
other directions but that can be fixed by using what i created but just in different subtractions in the index.
