when to stop recursion:
-no more positive words, must use all
-when the word doesn't fit. If it doesnt fit, need to check other ways
	-horizontal, reverse horizontal
	-vertical, reverse vertical
	-diagonal, reverse diagonal
-check if a no word exists after adding the word into the function
-check if there is a character already there

To check horizontally:
check that the size of the word will fit
check each spot to see if it has something there already
check if the first letter already there
add the word horizontally
check if the word will cause the board to have a bad word- dont have if there is a bad word
